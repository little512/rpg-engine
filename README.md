# rpg-engine

An RPG engine made in Lua with [LÃ–VE](https://www.love2d.org) (Love2d).

## What is this?

This is going to be a JRPG-style engine, reminiscent of Pokemon or Final Fantasy, which I intend on using to make games with.

## Can I use it?

Sure! See the [LICENSE](../master/LICENSE) for more info :)

## I don't want to copy it exactly, can I take bits of it?

You can do that too! If you have any questions see the [LICENSE](../master/LICENSE).

## Can I contribute to it?

Absolutely! Any changes or features you'd like to add I'm more than happy to review and consider merging with the main branch.

If you're not sure where to start, check out the [Todo list](https://github.com/users/little512/projects/1) or the [open issues](../../issues).

## When will it be finished?

I have no idea. I'm going to keep working on it until I feel it's satisfactory enough for a full game to be made with it.
