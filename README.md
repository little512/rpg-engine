# rpg-engine

An RPG engine made in Lua with [LÃ–VE](https://www.love2d.org) (Love2d).

## What is this?

This is going to be a JRPG-style engine, reminiscent of Pokemon or Final Fantasy, which I intend on using to make games with.

## Can I use it?

Sure! See the [LICENSE](../blob/master/LICENSE) for more info :)

## I don't want to copy it exactly, can I take bits of it?

You can do that too! If you have any questions see the [LICENSE](../blob/master/LICENSE).

## Can I contribute to it?

Absolutely! Any changes or features you'd like to add I'm more than happy to review and consider merging with the main branch.

## When will it be finished?

I have no idea. I'm going to keep working on it until I feel it's satisfactory enough for a full game to be made with it.
